Join the Trivandrum Python Community for a free, online deep dive into the core mechanics of asyncio. In this session, led by Jothir Adithyan (Software Engineer at Nike), we will peel back the layers of Python's asynchronous I/O framework to understand exactly how it operates under the hood.

**About Deep Dive Python Sessions:** This series goes beyond the basics. We explore the internal architecture of Python, breaking down complex concepts to see how the language truly works at its core.
